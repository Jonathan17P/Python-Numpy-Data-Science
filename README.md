# Python Numpy Data Science Project: Litecoin

As an investor, it is important to not only understand the product you're investing into, but also the optimal times to invest in that product. Thus, I have used the tools provided by the Numpy Python package to run the 90 day statistics of Litecoin to better understand Litecoin trends. From this program, it was determined that the optimal time to invest in Litecoin, would be closer to the closing time of the cryptocurrency market.
